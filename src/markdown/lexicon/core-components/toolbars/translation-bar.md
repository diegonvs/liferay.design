<div class="page-description">The translation bar is a toolbar that allows the user to choose the languages when translating content.</div>

### Usage

* The toolbar is always used inside a form context.
* The toolbar has a default language which always appears to the leftmost side of the bar.
* Languages are added by clicking in the plus button.
* Changing the default language is possible using the link, which triggers a modal where to change the default language.
