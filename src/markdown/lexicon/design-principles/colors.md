Colors have a huge impact in a system. They define the visual identity, bring harmony, communicate, etc. Lexicon defines the following color palette that you are free to change for your own.

### Primary colors
Primary colors define part of Lexicon's visual identity. These colors have been carefully chosen for how easily they can be combined and with accessibility in mind.
